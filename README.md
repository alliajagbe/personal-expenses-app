# Personal Expense App

A Flutter App built alongside the completion of an online Flutter course.

## Features
- Stores all your weekly expenses. 
- Provides a chart page to show you how much was spent each day (with information on percentages). 
- Date Picker with a graphical user interface. 

## Note:
- This is a project developed alongside my learning from a Flutter Course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.
